# <p align="center">Deployment in Production Environment</p><a name="deployment"></a>
The API and Client can be deployed in a production environment.

 Branch **`prod`** includes detailed instructions on how this can be done.

 The instructions described from here on are meant for local deployment only, and differ from the instructions found in `prod` branch.
<br><br><br>


# <p align="center">Local Deployment via Docker</p><a name="deployment"></a>
The application can be deployed with the latest version of Docker. Docker automatically sets up the server and client, as well as populates the database with the data found in `example_data/example_data.csv`.

To deploy the application locally:

1. While in the root directory of the repository, build the Docker environment with:
    ```console
    docker compose up -d
    ```
2. After Docker is finished building the environment, two containers should be up and running named **GET-Food-Server** and **GET-Food-Client**.

> [!NOTE] 
> **GET-Food-Client** container includes NGINX as a proxy server to serve the client on the default **HTTP** port 80.

3. Navigate to `http://localhost` in your browser and you should see the UI of the application.

## <p align="center">Running the Flask Backend (Server)</p><a name="backend"></a>

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create and activate a Python Virtual Environment

1. Create a Python venv in the root directory of the repository with the command:
    ```console
    python -m venv venv
    ```
2. Activate the created virtual environment.
    - On **macOS** & **Linux** with:
    ```console
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
    - On **Windows** with:
    ```console
    source venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Python Dependencies

Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required Python libraries with:
```console
pip install -r server/requirements.txt
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Flask Server
Start the Flask backend with:

```console
python server/app.py
```

> [!NOTE] 
> By default, Flask runs at: http://127.0.0.1:5000/


## <p align="center">‚öõÔ∏è Running the React Frontend (Client)</p><a name="frontend"></a>


### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Navigate to the Frontend Folder

Open a new terminal or command prompt and move into the React (client) folder:

```console
cd client
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies

Before running React, install the necessary Node.js packages:

```console
npm install
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Start the React Development Server

To launch the frontend, run:

```console
npm start
```

> [!NOTE] 
> This will start a development server at: http://localhost:3000/ *(the browser should open automatically)*.

# <p align="center">API Documentations</p><a name="apidocs"></a>

The API documentations are done with [Swagger](https://swagger.io/docs/). After you have the Flask application running, you can find the documentations via a browser at *URL*/**apidocs**. 

For example, if you have the application running on localhost, you would find the API documentations at http://localhost/apidocs.


# <p align="center">Database</p><a name="database"></a>

This app uses `SQLAlchemy` in combination with `pysqlite3` as a database so it should generally be compatible with any sqlite database.

## <p align="center">Populating the Database</p><a name="populating"></a>

You can initially populate the Database with the provided script. The data for the population should be in an csv-file, with each row beeing an individual food item, its properties being seperated by a comma and a semicolon indicating the corresponding pictures. You seperate the food items using a line break to indicate the next food item. 

An example-file, `example_data.csv` with some images can be found in the `example_data` folder. Note that the path to the image is expected to be a relative path. You can populate the database with the example data by running the following *(when in the project folder)*:

```console
python ./server/populate_db.py ./example_data/example_data.csv
```

You can then accordingly run the script for populating the database using the following command *(when in the project folder)*: 

```console
python ./server/populate_db.py path/to/data.csv
```

# <p align="center">Unit tests</p><a name="unit-tests"></a>

The repository contains unit tests for testing the functionalitites of the **API endpoint**.

## <p align="center">Running API unit tests</p><a name="api-tests"></a>

After the backend (server) has been successfully set up, you can run the unit tests for the API and DB by:

1. Navigate to the `server` folder with:
    ```console
    cd GET-Food/server
    ```
2. Run the unit tests with:
    ```console
    pytest test_api.py
    ```
3. Run the database tests with 
    ```console
    pytest test_db.py
    ```
